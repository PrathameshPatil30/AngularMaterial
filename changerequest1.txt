1. Create a login component inside the root component.
2. The component will accept the username & password & auhenticate against a REST API (via an Angular 
     service)
3. If the authentication fails, display an error message inside the component (in red color).
4. If the authentication succeeds, imperatively navigate to "http://localhost:4200/contactmanager".
	* Use the Router service's "navigate()" method for imperative navigation

5. Create an "AuthService" as follows:
	export class AuthService
	{
		public Authenticate(username:string) : Observable<any>
		{
			//hit: http://localhost:3000/authentication/username
		}
	}

6. When the user navigates to contact manager app component, display the current username in the top right 
    corner of the toolbar component along with a "sign out" link below it.

7. When the sign out link is clicked, imperatively navigate to http://localhost:4200/login.
